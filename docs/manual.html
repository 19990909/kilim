<h1>Kilim. Release 0.5</h1>
<p>Last updated: May 24, 2008.

<p>Please send comments, encouragements, money, cakes, code fixes to
<b>kilim@malhar.net</b>. Thank you.
<h1>What is Kilim?</h1>

<p>A Java framework for fast, safe, cheap message passing. 

<p>The message passing (MP) paradigm is often seen as a superior
alternative to the typical mix of idioms in concurrent (shared-memory,
locks) and distributed programming (CORBA/RMI). MP eliminates worries
endemic to the shared-memory mindset: lock ordering, failure-coupling,
low-level data races and memory models. It simplifies synchronization
between data and control planes (no lost signals or updates), and
unifies APIs for local and remote process interaction.

<p>Curiously however, there are no efficient _and_ safe frameworks for
intra-process message-passing, except for Ada and Erlang. The Kilim
framework is intended to fix this state of affairs. It provides:

<ol>
<li>Extremely lightweight user-level threads (actors) with automatic
 stack management, obtained via CPS transformation.</li>

<li> A simple type system that ensures actor isolation by controlling
 pointer aliasing in messages at compile time, and by ensuring
 linear ownership of mutable message objects. This permits safe,
 zero-copy communication.<br>
 (NOTE: This feature is NOT included in this release because it
  is undergoing a rewrite. The docs/kilim_ecoop08.pdf paper gives
  details about what you can expect).</li>

<li> A compact run-time library containing typed mailboxes (with
 optional flow control), user-definable scheduling and python style
 generators.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Kilim is portable; one of our explicit goals was to not require
changes to the Java language syntax or to the JVM.

<p>
Kilim scales comfortably to handle hundreds of thousands of actors and
messages on modest hardware. It is fast as well -- task-switching is
1000x faster than Java threads and 60x faster than other lightweight
tasking frameworks, and message-passing is 3x faster than Erlang
(currently the gold standard for concurrency-oriented programming).

<p>
The term "Kilim" refers to a class of rugs in a number of
middle-eastern and central european countries. Kilims are light and
are flat-woven with thin threads (as opposed to deep-pile carpets).


<h1>Getting started. </h1>

<p>The first few pages of the <a href="kilim_ecoop08.pdf">ECOOP'08 paper</a> give an overview
of the facilities and the programming model. 

<p>Take a look at the examples to get an idea. The only important classes 
to begin with are kilim.Task and kilim.Mailbox.

<p>Let's start with conventional thread programming. This is how you
create your own thread in Java.

<pre>
   class MyThread extends Thread {
      public void run() {
      }
   }
</pre>
<p>And spawn a thread thus:
<pre>
  new MyThread().start();
</pre>
<p>Now, if you replace the words "Thread" with "Task", "run" with
"execute" and add an <code>@pausable</code> annotation to <code>execute()</code>,  you have a
Kilim Task. Simple.

<pre>
   import kilim.*;

   public class MyTask extends Task {

     @pausable
     public void execute() {
     }
   }
</pre>
and to start it, you say <code>new MyTask().start()</code>

<p>A method marked pausable is one that calls another pausable method; the
built-in ones are Task.yield() and Task.sleep() (mailbox.get() calls
Task.yield()).

<p>The only difference is that you can spawn a million of these
without turning your computer into a room heater. These tasks
get executed on a thread pool. 


<h1>Communication</h1>

<p>Mailboxes are the medium of communication between tasks. They are
typed buffers that can have at most one consumer task waiting on it at
any point in time, but multiple producers are allowed. Mailboxes are
not owned by anyone (unlike Erlang's process mailbox). They can be
static fields, instance variables, local variables .. it is your
design choice. They can even be sent as part of messages themselves,
which can make for an extremely dynamic and mobile topology.

<p>Creating a mailbox:
<pre>
   // This mailbox only allows Strings
   Mailbox &lt;String&gt; mb = new Mailbox&lt;String&gt;(); 
</pre>
<p>Sending and receiving messages:
<pre>
   mb.put("hello"); 
   String s = mb.get();
</pre>
<p>These two methods block the task (not the java Thread) when they are
unable to perform the operation. How does one know ? They are marked
<code>@pausable</code>.

<p><code>mailbox.getnb()</code> and <code>putnb()</code> are the non-blocking versions: they are
not pausable, and they return quickly.

<p><code>mailbox.getb()</code> and putb are the *thread*-blocking versions. Use them if you want to wait for a message but cannot make the calling method
pausable (like <code>main()</code>, for example). You shouldn't be using these
inside a task.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

<p>First, the lightweight thread part. 

<p>This package comes with a bytecode transformation tool called Weaver
(package: kilim.tools.Weaver) that post-processes .class files
looking for the @pausable annotation.

<p>When a task needs to block (or "pause", calling <code>Task.sleep()</code>, for
example), the task unwinds its stack, squirrels away all state that
it'll need later on resumption.  This unwinding and rewinding the
stack is automatically performed by the code introduced by the Weaver.
(Debug information is adjusted so that the transformed code can be
debugged inside eclipse)

<p>The transformation is a variation of continuation passing style; the
details are in the paper entitled "A Thread of Ones Own" presented at
the Workshop on New Horizons in Compilers (2006). A simple introduction
to CPS is in the accompanying IFAQ.txt.


<h1>Building, running the examples</h1>

<p>Build the sources by running ant (or build.sh) at the topmost
level. 

<p>To manually compile a kilim task (say kilim.examples.SimpleTask), 

<p>Now, compile (into "./classes")
<pre>
   javac -d ./classes ./examples/kilim/examples/SimpleTask.java
</pre>
<p>Weave the class (and overwrite it).
<pre>
  java kilim.tools.Weaver -d ./classes kilim.examples.SimpleTask
</pre>
<p>Run it like any regular java program.
<pre>  java -cp ./classes kilim.examples.SimpleTask</pre>

<p>Create a million tasks just for the heck of it.
<p>  Try <code>java kilim.bench.LotsOfTasks 1000000</code>
<p>  (Notice the JIT's effect after the first round)

<p>You can supply a different directory for the weaver's output, but
remember to include that directory in the classpath before the 
original, otherwise you will "class not woven" errors at run time.

<p>NOTE: It is safer (and convenient) to supply the entire directory to 
weave, like this:
<pre>
 java kilim.tools.Weave  -d ./classes  ./classes  
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^
</pre>
That eliminates the chances of mistakenly omitting to weave inner
and anonymous classes.

<h2>Eclipse notes:</h2>

<p>Loading kilim under eclipse is like any other java project.
<p>Select <code>File -> New -> Java Project</code>
<p>"Create project from existing source"

<p>.There is no plugin (yet) to run the weaver automatically; you will have
to run the weaver separately in the command line. If you are changing
the kilim examples, you can just run "build.sh" or "ant" from the 
command line once the project's been created.

<p>Debugging and profiling should work as usual.

<h1>Future directions</h1>

<p>The immediate future release will include the type system for process isolation and 
then, remote mailboxes for distributed programming.

<p>Suggestions most welcome and will be duly acknowledged.
